# Build and run open source cloud native workloads on LinuxONE using Docker

Open source software has expanded from a low-cost alternative to a platform for enterprise databases, clouds and next-generation apps. These workloads need higher levels of scalability, security and availability from the underlying hardware infrastructure.

LinuxONE was built for open source so you can harness the agility of the open revolution on the industryâ€™s most secure, scalable and high-performing Linux server. In this journey we will show how to run open source Cloud-Native workloads on LinuxONE using Docker. We will show how existing LinuxONE docker images from docker hub can be used as is for deploying open source workloads. 

If the desired images don't exist, we also show how you can create your own dokcer images for the workload. The z architecture has a different instruction set from the typical machines used in distributed environments. If the Dockerfile has build steps that build native code, the right platform of the compile flags must be used to make it work on LinuxONE, in addition to accounting for specific packages which can be used with LinuxONE. The second part of this Journey goes into those details.

## Prerequisites

Register at [LinuxONE Community Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxone/) for a trial account. We will be using a Ret Hat base image for this journey, so be sure to chose the 'Request your trial' button on the left side of this page.

## Scenario One: Use Docker images from Docker hub to run your workloads on LinuxONE

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) makes it rather simple to get started with containers, as there are quite a few images ready to for your to use.  You can browse the list of images that are compatible with LinuxONE by doing a search on the ['s390x'](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=s390x&starCount=0) tag.

These instructions assume a base RHEL 7.2 image.

We need to be running as root:
```shell
$ sudo su -
```

### Install docker
First, we will need to download the correct Docker package archive from [this page](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/linux390/docker.html).  For version 1.11.2 on RHEL 7.2:
```shell
# wget ftp://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/linuxpatch/s390x/redhat/rhel7.2/docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623.tar.gz
```

Then, unpack the archive and copy the docker binarys:
```shell
# tar -xzvf docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623.tar.gz
# cp docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623/docker* /usr/local/bin/
```

And then start the docker daemon:
```shell
# docker daemon -g /local/docker/lib &
```
You should see something similar to this:
```shell
[root@devjourney07 ~]# docker daemon -g /local/docker/lib &
[1] 2332
[root@devjourney07 ~]# INFO[0000] New containerd process, pid: 2338

INFO[0001] API listen on /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Install docker-compose

Install dependencies

```shell
# yum install -y python-setuptools
```

Install pip with easy_install

```shell
# easy_install pip
```

Upgrade backports.ssl_match_hostname

```shell
# pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname --upgrade
```

Finally, install docker-compose itself
```shell
# pip install docker-compose
```
### 1. Install and run WebSphere Liberty

In this step, we will once again be using existing images from Docker Hub - this time to set up a WebSphere Application Server.  We will be implementing it for Java EE 7 Full Platform compliance.

#### 1. Docker Run

Now run the container (note: we will need to be logged in as root)

```shell
# docker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 s390x/websphere-liberty:webProfile7
```

#### 2. Browse

Once the server is started, you can browse to
`http://[LinuxOne Host IP]`.

### 2. Install and run WordPress

Let's start off with everyone's favorite demo: an installation of WordPress. These instructions assume a base RHEL 7.2 image. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/Scalable-WordPress-deployment-on-Kubernetes/blob/master/docs/deploy-with-docker-on-linuxone.md#steps) to Install and run WordPress on LinuxOne

## Scenario Two: Create your own Docker images for LinuxONE

In our previous scenario, we used a couple of container images that had already been created and were waiting for our use in the Docker Hub Community.  But what if you are looking to run a workload that is not currently available there?  In this scenario, we will walk through the steps to create your own Docker images.

### 1. Install and run GitLab

GitLab is famous for its Git-based and code-tracking tool. GitLab represents a typical multi-tier app and each component will have their own container(s). The microservice containers will be for the web tier, the state/job database with Redis and PostgreSQL as the database.

By using different GitLab components (NGINX, Ruby on Rails, Redis, PostgreSQL, and more), you can deploy it to LinuxONE. 

For this exercise, we will need a total of three containers, one each for
Redis, Postgresql, and Gitlab.  Docker images must be specially created for
the z Systems platform, and currently there a limited number of these that
exist.  But lucky for us, there is already an image for
[Redis](https://hub.docker.com/r/s390x/redis/), so we will be using it!

For Gitlab and Postgresql, however, s390x images do not exist, so we will have
to get a bit creative.  For Gitlab, the heavy lifting has already been done
for us in a separate
[repo](https://github.com/IBM/container-service-gitlab-sample).  We merely
need to copy the contents of the Gitlab container directory, which consists of
two install scripts and a Dockerfile.  Thanks to the portability of docker
images, all we have to do is change the first line of the Dockerfile from
`FROM alpine:3.5` to `FROM s390x/alpine`

For Postgres, we are going to borrow a Dockerfile from the [docker docs]
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/postgresql_service/) site.  Again, the
only changes we will be making is modifying the base image to be compatable
with LinuxONE (changing `FROM ubuntu` to 'FROM s390x/ubuntu`) and adding our
database setup script:

Dockerfile-postgres

```text
#
# example Dockerfile for https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/postgresql_service/
#

FROM s390x/ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Add the PostgreSQL PGP key to verify their Debian packages.
# It should be the same key as https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc
RUN apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys B97B0AFCAA1A47F044F244A07FCC7D46ACCC4CF8

# Install ``python-software-properties``, ``software-properties-common`` and PostgreSQL
#  There are some warnings (in red) that show up during the build. You can hide
#  them by prefixing each apt-get statement with DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-software-properties software-properties-common postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-contrib

# Note: The official Debian and Ubuntu images automatically ``apt-get clean``
# after each ``apt-get``

# Run the rest of the commands as the ``postgres`` user created by the ``postgres`` package when it was ``apt-get installed``
USER postgres

# Create a PostgreSQL role named ``docker`` with ``docker`` as the password and
# then create a database `docker` owned by the ``docker`` role.
# Note: here we use ``&&\`` to run commands one after the other - the ``\``
#       allows the RUN command to span multiple lines.
RUN    /etc/init.d/postgresql start &&\
    psql --command "CREATE USER docker WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'docker';" &&\
    createdb -O docker docker

# Adjust PostgreSQL configuration so that remote connections to the
# database are possible.
RUN echo "host all  all    0.0.0.0/0  md5" >> /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf

# And add ``listen_addresses`` to ``/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf``
RUN echo "listen_addresses='*'" >> /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf

# copy database setup script
COPY gitlab-db-setup.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

# Expose the PostgreSQL port
EXPOSE 5432

# Add VOLUMEs to allow backup of config, logs and databases
VOLUME  ["/etc/postgresql", "/var/log/postgresql", "/var/lib/postgresql"]

# Set the default command to run when starting the container
CMD ["/usr/lib/postgresql/9.5/bin/postgres", "-D", "/var/lib/postgresql/9.5/main", "-c", "config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf"]
```

### 2. Define service in a Compose file

Again, we are going to use docker-compose to manage our Docker images.  In the
project directory, create a `docker-compose.yml` file that contains a slightly
modified version of the file by the same name in the root of the
[repo](https://github.com/IBM/container-service-gitlab-sample) from which we
borrowed our gitlab dockerfile:

```text
postgresql:
  restart: always
  build: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-postgres
  environment:
    - DB_USER=gitlab
    - DB_PASS=password
    - DB_NAME=gitlabhq_production
  volumes:
    - postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql:rw
gitlab:
  restart: always
  build: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-gitlab
  links:
    - redis:redis
    - postgresql:postgresql
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "22:22"
  environment:
    - GITLAB_HOST=my.gitlab-server
  volumes:
    - gitlab:/home/git/data:rw
redis:
  restart: always
  image: s390x/redis
  volumes:
    - redis:/var/lib/redis:rw
```


Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/Kubernetes-container-service-GitLab-sample/blob/master/docs/deploy-with-docker-on-linuxone.md
) to get it up and running
