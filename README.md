# Build and run open source cloud native workloads on LinuxONE using Docker

Open source software has expanded from a low-cost alternative to a platform for enterprise databases, clouds and next-generation apps. These workloads need higher levels of scalability, security and availability from the underlying hardware infrastructure.

LinuxONE was built for open source so you can harness the agility of the open revolution on the industryâ€™s most secure, scalable and high-performing Linux server. In this journey we will show how to run open source Cloud-Native workloads on LinuxONE using Docker. We will show how existing LinuxONE docker images from docker hub can be used as is for deploying open source workloads. 

If the desired images don't exist, we also show how you can create your own dokcer images for the workload. The z architecture has a different instruction set from the typical machines used in distributed environments. If the Dockerfile has build steps that build native code, the right platform of the compile flags must be used to make it work on LinuxONE, in addition to accounting for specific packages which can be used with LinuxONE. The second part of this Journey goes into those details.

## Prerequisites

Register at [LinuxONE Community Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxone/) for a trial account. We will be using a Ret Hat base image for this journey, so be sure to chose the 'Request your trial' button on the left side of this page.

## Scenario One: Use Docker images from Docker hub to run your workloads on LinuxONE

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) makes it rather simple to get started with containers, as there are quite a few images ready to for your to use.  You can browse the list of images that are compatible with LinuxONE by doing a search on the ['s390x'](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=s390x&starCount=0) tag.

These instructions assume a base RHEL 7.2 image.

We need to be running as root:
```shell
$ sudo su -
```

### Install docker
First, we will need to download the correct Docker package archive from [this page](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/linux390/docker.html).  For version 1.11.2 on RHEL 7.2:
```shell
# wget ftp://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/linuxpatch/s390x/redhat/rhel7.2/docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623.tar.gz
```

Then, unpack the archive and copy the docker binarys:
```shell
# tar -xzvf docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623.tar.gz
# cp docker-1.11.2-rhel7.2-20160623/docker* /usr/local/bin/
```

And then start the docker daemon:
```shell
# docker daemon -g /local/docker/lib &
```
You should see something similar to this:
```shell
[root@devjourney07 ~]# docker daemon -g /local/docker/lib &
[1] 2332
[root@devjourney07 ~]# INFO[0000] New containerd process, pid: 2338

WARN[0000] containerd: low RLIMIT_NOFILE changing to max  current=1024 max=4096

INFO[0001] API listen on /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Install docker-compose

Install dependencies

```shell
# yum install -y python-setuptools
```

Install pip with easy_install

```shell
# easy_install pip
```

Upgrade backports.ssl_match_hostname

```shell
# pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname --upgrade
```

Finally, install docker-compose itself
```shell
# pip install docker-compose
```
### 1. Install and run WebSphere Liberty

In this step, we will once again be using existing images from Docker Hub - this time to set up a WebSphere Application Server.  We will be implementing it for Java EE 7 Full Platform compliance.

#### 1. Docker Run

Now run the container (note: we will need to be logged in as root)

```shell
# docker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 s390x/websphere-liberty:webProfile7
```

#### 2. Browse

Once the server is started, you can browse to
`http://[LinuxOne Host IP]`.

### 2. Install and run WordPress

Let's start off with everyone's favorite demo: an installation of WordPress. These instructions assume a base RHEL 7.2 image. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/Scalable-WordPress-deployment-on-Kubernetes/blob/master/docs/deploy-with-docker-on-linuxone.md#steps) to Install and run WordPress on LinuxOne

## Scenario Two: Create your own Docker images for LinuxONE

In our previous scenario, we used a couple of container images that had already been created and were waiting for our use in the Docker Hub Community.  But what if you are looking to run a workload that is not currently available there?  In this scenario, we will walk through the steps to create your own Docker images.

This time we will go through the process of migrating an existing docker-compose.yaml from another architecture to the LinuxONE architecture.

### 1. Obtain the MEAN stack Docker components from GitHub

The MEAN stack is a combination of several packages starting with MongoDB - which is the most popular OSS NoSQL DB. The M*EAN* components stand for Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, Express.js is a server framework and Angular.js is an all-purpose MVC/MVVN framework. We will use this [blog](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-mean-app-with-angular-2-and-docker-compose) and this [source code](https://github.com/gangachris/mean-docker/tree/master/express-server) as a starting point. This blog is also useful if you're new to Angular.js/Express.js.

```shell
version: '2' # specify docker-compose version

# Define the services/containers to be run
services:
  angular: # name of the first service
    build: angular-client # specify the directory of the Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4200:4200" # specify port forewarding

  express: #name of the second service
    build: express-server # specify the directory of the Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" #specify ports forewarding
    links:
      - database

  database: # name of the third service
    image: mongo # specify image to build container from
    ports:
      - "27017:27017" # specify port forewarding
```

### 2. Point to LinuxONE binaries of MongoDB and Node.js

The ``image:``` tag in the docker-compose.yml and the base image name ```FROM node:6``` for the [express-server/Dockerfile](https://github.com/gangachris/mean-docker/blob/master/express-server/Dockerfile) currently point to x86 version of the binaries. In order to run on the LinuxONE platform, we need to point them to the z architecture compatible binaries. A quick search on DockerHub will reveal [sinenomine/mongodb-s390x](https://hub.docker.com/r/sinenomine/mongodb-s390x/) and [s390x/ibmnode](https://hub.docker.com/r/s390x/ibmnode/). Just add a ```:latest``` tag and update the appropriate locations.

### 3. Start the MEAN stack on LinuxONE.

Clone the repo and navigate to the correct directory
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/Cloud-Native-Workloads-on-LinuxONE.git
$ cd Cloud-Native-Workloads-on-LinuxONE/files/mean-docker
```

```docker-compose up -d``` point your browser to ```http://[host ip]:8080``` and enjoy!

### 4. Customizing the application

All customizations to the application can be made in the [src](https://github.com/gangachris/mean-docker/tree/master/angular-client/src) folder for Angular.js and [api.js](https://github.com/gangachris/mean-docker/blob/master/express-server/routes/api.js) for Express.js. Then simply run the ```docker-compose down``` and ```docker-compose up``` to bring up the MEAN stack with your new code. You can do your application development on any platform, push to github, pull on LinuxONE and bring up the containers without needing any changes to your JavaScript code.

Note, some version number updates were made to Angular's package.json to ensure major security flaws were fixed. The original blog was quite dated and the [new code](files/mean-docker) should be up to date.

## Troubleshooting

If containers are not able to talk to each other, the docker daemon may need to be restarted.  Use ```top``` to find the PID of the daemon, use ```kill -9``` to end that process and then start the docker daemon again.
